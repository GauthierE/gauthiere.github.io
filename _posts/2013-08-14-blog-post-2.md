While reading *Elements of the Representation Theory of Associative Algebras* by Andrzej Skowronski, Daniel Simson, and Ibrahim Assem, I came across a step in a proof that I didn’t find immediately obvious. I proved this step using composition series and the Jordan-Hölder theorem. 

The step appears in the proof of Corollary 3.4 in Chapter 2:

> If $$A$$ is a basic and connected finite dimensional algebra, then the quiver $$Q_A$$ of $$A$$ is connected.

## Proof as given in the textbook

The proof in the book is as follows: if this is not the case, then the set $$(Q_A)_0$$ of points of $$Q_A$$ can be written as the disjoint union of two nonempty sets $$Q_0'$$ and $$Q_0''$$ such that the points of $$Q_0'$$ are not connected to those of $$Q_0''$$. We show that, if $$i \in Q_0'$$ and $$j \in Q_0''$$, we have $$e_iAe_j = 0$$ and $$e_jAe_i = 0$$. Then (1.6) will imply that $$A$$ is not connected, a contradiction. Because $$i \neq j$$, (I.4.2) yields:

$$
\begin{split}
e_iAe_j &\cong \text{Hom}_A(e_jA,e_iA) \\
&\cong \text{Hom}_A(e_jA, \text{rad }e_iA) \qquad (*)\\
&\cong (\text{rad } e_iA)e_j \\
&\cong e_i(\text{rad } A)e_j.\\
\end{split}
$$

The conclusion follows at once from (3.3).

The step $$(*)$$ is non-trivial to me. I came up with a proof that relies on composition series and the Jordan-Hölder theorem. I will recall some facts about composition series, which can be found on page 17:

## Background on Composition Series and the Jordan-Hölder Theorem

Suppose that $$A$$ is a finite-dimensional $$K$$-algebra. If $$M$$ is a module in $$\text{mod } A$$, then there exists a chain 

$$
\begin{split}
0 = M_0 \subseteq M_1 \subseteq M_2 \subseteq \dots \subseteq M_m = M \\
\end{split}
$$ 

of submodules of $$M$$ such that the module $$M_{j+1}/M_j$$ is simple for $$j = 0, 1, \dots, m - 1$$. This chain is called a **composition series** of $$M$$, and the simple modules $$M_{j+1}/M_j$$ for $$j = 0, 1, \dots, m-1$$ are called the **composition factors** of $$M$$.

### 3.10. Jordan–Hölder Theorem
If $$A$$ is a finite-dimensional $$K$$-algebra and

$$
\begin{split}
0 &= M_0 \subset M_1 \subset M_2 \subset \dots \subset M_m = M, \\
0 &= N_0 \subset N_1 \subset N_2 \subset \dots \subset N_n = M
\end{split}
$$ 

are two composition series of a module $$M$$ in $$\text{mod } A$$, then $$m = n$$, and there exists a permutation $$\sigma$$ of $$\{1, \dots, m\}$$ such that, for any $$j \in \{0, 1, \dots, m - 1\}$$, there is an $$A$$-isomorphism
$$M_{j+1}/M_j \cong N_{\sigma(j+1)}/N_{\sigma(j)}$$.

It follows that the number $$m$$ of modules in a composition series 
$$0 = M_0 \subset M_1 \subset M_2 \subset \dots \subset M_m = M$$ 
of $$M$$ depends only on $$M$$; it is called the **length** of $$M$$ and is denoted by $$\ell(M)$$.

As an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.10, we get the following.

### 3.11. Corollary
(a) If $$N$$ is an $$A$$-submodule of $$M$$ in $$\text{mod } A$$, then 
$$\ell(M) = \ell(N) + \ell(M/N)$$.

(b) If $$L$$ and $$N$$ are $$A$$-submodules of $$M$$ in $$\text{mod } A$$, then 
$$\ell(L + N) + \ell(L \cap N) = \ell(L) + \ell(N)$$.

## Proof of $$(*)$$

Now, we prove the isomorphism $$\text{Hom}_A(e_jA,e_iA) \cong \text{Hom}_A(e_jA, \text{rad }e_iA)$$ for $$i \neq j$$.

Let $$i \neq j$$, and let $$\varphi \in \text{Hom}_A(e_jA,e_iA)$$. Since the algebra $$A$$ is basic, we have $$e_jA \not\cong e_iA$$, meaning that $$\varphi$$ cannot be an isomorphism.

Assume, for contradiction, that $$\varphi$$ is surjective. Consider a composition series for $$e_jA$$:

$$
\begin{split}
0 = M_0 \subseteq \dots \subseteq M_m = e_jA.
\end{split}
$$

Applying $$\varphi$$ to this chain gives a series (not necessarily a composition series) for $$e_iA$$, due to the surjectivity of $$\varphi$$:

$$
\begin{split}
0 = \varphi(M_0) \subseteq \dots \subseteq \varphi(M_m) = \varphi(e_jA) = e_iA.
\end{split}
$$

This series can be refined to a composition series for $$e_iA$$. Thus, we obtain 

$$
\ell(e_jA) \leq \ell(e_iA). \qquad (1) \\
$$

On the other hand, since $$\ell(e_jA) = \ell(\text{Ker } \varphi) + \ell(e_jA/\text{Ker } \varphi)$$ by Corollary 3.11(a), and since $$e_jA/\text{Ker } \varphi \cong \text{Im } \varphi = e_iA$$ by surjectivity of $$\varphi$$, we have: 

$$
\ell(e_jA) = \ell(\text{Ker } \varphi) + \ell(e_iA). \qquad (2)\\
$$

From $$(1)$$ and $$(2)$$, we deduce that $$\ell(\text{Ker } \varphi) = 0$$, so $$\text{Ker } \varphi = 0$$. Hence, $$\varphi$$ is injective. Since we assumed that $$\varphi$$ is also surjective, it follows that $$\varphi$$ is an isomorphim, which contradicts the fact that $$e_jA \not\cong e_iA$$. Therefore $$\varphi$$ cannot be surjective.

This implies that $$\text{Im } \varphi$$ is a proper submodule of $$e_iA$$. By (I.4.5)(c), $$\text{rad } e_iA$$ is the unique proper maximal submodule of $$e_iA$$, so $$\text{Im } \varphi \subseteq \text{rad } e_iA$$. This yields a natural isomorphism:

$$
\begin{split}
\Phi: \varphi \in \text{Hom}_A(e_jA,e_iA)\mapsto  \varphi\vert^{\text{rad }e_iA} \in \text{Hom}_A(e_jA, \text{rad }e_iA), \\
\end{split}
$$

where $$\varphi \vert ^{\text{rad } e_iA}$$​ is $$\varphi$$, regarded as a homomorphism with codomain $$\text{rad }e_iA$$.
